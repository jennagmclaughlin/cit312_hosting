            Why are you taking this class?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I'm taking this class as an elective. I've always been a fan of web design, and I hope to pursue it as a career. I realized a little too late that I should've majored in CIT and not CGT, but oh well. I'm picking up valuable design skills in CGT that I'm
            hoping to apply to this CIT class.
        </p>
